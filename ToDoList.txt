square lattice example:
2 districts
_ precinct flow (tempering)
x COM flow (tempering)

3 districts (need to think about energy)
(energy -- add population and isoperimetric)
_ precinct flow (tempering)
_ COM flow (tempering)
_ district-to-district flow (tempering)

Real world examples: Only worry about population and compactness
Alamance; House (2 districts)
x Single node flip
_ Single node flip with tempering
_ precinct flow (tempering)
_ COM flow (tempering)

Mecklenburg; Senate (5 districts)
x Single node flip
_ Single node flip with tempering
_ precinct flow (tempering)
_ COM flow (tempering)
_ district-to-district flow (tempering)

NC; Congressional (13 districts)
_ Single node flip
_ Single node flip with tempering
_ precinct flow (tempering)
_ COM flow (tempering)
_ district-to-district flow (tempering)
