square lattice example:
2 districts
_ no tempering; no skew
_ tempering no skew
_ precinct flow (tempering)
x COM flow (tempering)

===========
Make a heat map of which nodes have been flipped for all 7 runs
Make a heat maps of which nodes are on the boundary for all 7 runs
===========

Question -- after 1 million runs, what is the distribution of the front:
	i) for each node, find the number of times it has flipped
	ii) for each node, find the number samples it lies on the boundary

3 districts (need to think about energy)
(energy -- add population and isoperimetric)
_ precinct flow (tempering)
_ COM flow (tempering)
_ district-to-district flow (tempering)

Real world examples: Only worry about population and compactness
Alamance; House (2 districts)
x Single node flip
_ Single node flip with tempering
_ COM flow (tempering)

Mecklenburg; Senate (5 districts)
x Single node flip
_ Single node flip with tempering
_ COM flow (tempering)
_ district-to-district flow (tempering)
_ cyles

NC; Congressional (13 districts)
_ Single node flip
_ Single node flip with tempering
_ precinct flow (tempering)
_ COM flow (tempering)
_ district-to-district flow (tempering)
